## 📨 EmailJS Setup

1. Go to [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/) and sign up.
2. Create a new **Email Service**, **Email Template**, and get your **User ID**.
3. Replace placeholders in `ContactForm.jsx`:

```js
emailjs.send(
  'your_service_id',
  'your_template_id',
  formData,
  'your_user_id'
);
```

## 🔒 Environment Variables

If you wish to move your EmailJS credentials to environment variables, use a `.env` file:

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_user_id
```

Then access them like this:

```js
import.meta.env.VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID
```

> 🔐 Make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore` to avoid exposing secrets.
